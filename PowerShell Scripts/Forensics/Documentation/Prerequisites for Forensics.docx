Prerequisites for Forensics
•	Storage Account with two containers. One for scripts and one for VHD files
o	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal
•	Service principal account that has the appropriate rights to read and retrieve the keys for the forensics storage account as well as download data.
•	Create Service principal application secret
o	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal
•	KeyVault with the secret for the SPN entered. Whatever account runs the script will need access to the keys within KeyVault
o	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal
•	Resource group for created items to land so the delete permissions for RBAC can be applied at the RG level not at the root level. Only delete permissions at root level will be vm extension delete permissions.
Data to have for static variables during runtime and variables it maps to in script
SPN Application ID - $userName
SPN Password that you create – Entered in Key Vault and programmatically acquired during script run
KeyVault name - $keyVaultName
KeyVault password name - when entering a secret into KeyVault you will create a new entry and the name of that entry is needed - $keyVaultSecretName
Subscription ID of forensics subscription - $forensicsSubscriptionID
Resource group name for forensics subscription - $forensicsVMResourceGroup
Forensics VM Name - $forensicsVMName
Forensics Storage Account Name - $forensicSAName
Storage Container Name that contain memory capture scripts- $forensicsScriptSAContainer
Storage Container Name that allows for transfer of VHD files – storageVHDContaine- rName
Amount of time to extract VHD files from managed disks - $sasExpiryDuration
Storage Account Prefix for newly created storage account to match attacked VM region - $saPrefix
Tenant ID - $tenantId
Windows Memory Capture Script name - $memCapScript
Linux Memory Capture script name - $memCapScriptLinux
Variables to enter at run time - This call all be gathered from the overview blade of the attacked VM
Resource group of attacked VM -  $attackedVMResourceGroupName
Attacked VM subscription ID -  $attackedSubscriptionID 

Attacked VM Name -  $attackedVMName

Static data to enter in scripts – VHD Capture Parent
•	$driveLetter = (Get-Volume | Where-Object { $_.FileSystemLabel -eq "vhdFiles" }).DriveLetter + ":/"
o	vhdFiles is the name of the disk you want to download the VHD file to. In the example below vhdFiles would be replaced with OSDisk
o	The disk should be large enough to hold the VHD files you plan to capture
o	 
Static data to enter in scripts – Memory capture windows child
o	$memCapDrive = Get-PSDrive | Where-Object Description -EQ MemCap
o	MemCap is the name of the disk you want to download the VHD file to. In the example below MemCap would be replaced with OSDisk
o	This disk should be large enough to hold all data downloaded to it including all memory capture files
o	 


How to build the Linux tools disk
#Attach new disk to Linux VM
attach disk to Linux vm
#Makes current user root
sudo su –
#Make the mount directory
mkdir /mnt/diskname
#Mount disk to new mount point
mount /dev/diskname /mnt/diskname
#Partition new disk
fdisk /dev/diskname
#Type the letters below on each screen 
n
p
default [hit enter]
default [hit enter]
default [hit enter]
w
#Creates ex4 partition
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc1
#Make directory
mkdir /mnt/sdc1
#Mount disk to directory
mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/sdc1
#Change directory to new directory
cd /mnt/sdc1
#Get ftkimager CLI version
wget -O ubuntu.tar.gz https://ad-zip.s3.amazonaws.com/ftkimager.3.1.1_ubuntu64.tar.gz
#Extract forensics file
tar -xf ubuntu.tar.gz
#Set label to Forensics as the Linux automation script will reach the disk NAMED Forensics
e2label /dev/sdc1 FORENSICS
# when done unmount disk and detach from VM – This is a static resource that needs to be in the forensics resource group not attached to the VM
How to build the Windows disks
#Attach disk to VM
Create new disk and attach to Windows VM
#Partition new disk
Open disk management (diskmgmt.msc) and find the drive that is unallocated
Create new drive allocating all space to the disk
Make sure to name the disk memcap as that is what the forensics script expects
	If this is for the VHD capture disk name it vhdFiles
#Detach memcap disk and keep in resource group as this will move to the attacked vm subscription to run the tool on the machine, leave vhdfiles disk attached as this is the directory the vhd capture script will download the vhd file to
